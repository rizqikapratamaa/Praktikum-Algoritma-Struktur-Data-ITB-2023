# Algorithm and Data Structures Lab

Welcome to my Algorithm and Data Structures Lab repository! This repository contains solutions for Algorithm and Data Structures lab assignments that I completed during my coursework in the Computer Science program at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) in 2023, while I was in my third semester. Below is a brief description of the lab and a table containing information on lab number, topic, and obtained scores.

## Lab Description

The Algorithm and Data Structures Lab is a part of the Computer Science program at ITB, designed to sharpen programming skills and enhance understanding of fundamental algorithmic concepts and data structures. Each lab covers relevant topics and provides opportunities for students to implement the knowledge acquired in lectures.
